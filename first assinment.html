                    <p> Here’s a scenario that might sound familiar: you are listening to a speech or presentation, or
                        perhaps you are reading an article, an essay, or a report, and it becomes clear that the writer
                        is using words without communicating. Some essays, articles, and books might be pleasant to read
                        because the language is colorful, and a speaker might make pleasant, sincere-sounding noises. No
                        doubt some of your my writing or speaking can be described this way. If you don’t think yours
                        can, just wait. As you improve, you will expect more of yourself. One way to improve is to
                        practice writing with word or character
                        limits</p>

                    <p> We agreed on the urgency to accelerate vaccinations in LICs, where under 5% of the population is
                        fully vaccinated, as well as in LMICs, where around 30% of the population is fully vaccinated.
                        We agreed to work with countries to support and strengthen their national vaccination goals
                        consistent with the global target to vaccinate 70% of the populations in all countries by
                        mid-2022. The emergence of the Omicron variant underscores the vital need for fair and broad
                        access to vaccines as well as testing, sequencing, and treatments to end the pandemic </p>
